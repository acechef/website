  Install mysql operator
---

There are several different ways to install and deploy the [MySQL Operator](http://www.grds.cloud/)
based upon your use case.

For the vast majority of use cases, we recommend using the [Helm]({{< relref "./helm.md" >}}),

Before selecting your installation method, it's important that you first read
the [prerequisites]({{< relref "./prerequisites.md" >}}) for your
deployment environment to ensure that your setup meets the needs for installing
the PostgreSQL Operator.
